# This is a Python function that takes in a list of numbers
# and returns the largest prime number in the list

def largest\_prime(numbers):
# Initialize the largest prime to None
largest\_prime = None

# Loop through each number in the list
for num in numbers:
# If the number is less than 2, it cannot be prime
# so we continue to the next number
if num < 2:
